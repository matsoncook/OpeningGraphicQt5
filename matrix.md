If your translation is happening in `matrix[3, 0]`, it's likely that you're using a **row-major** or **column-major** convention that differs from the standard 4x4 transformation matrix format.

### Possible Explanation
The typical transformation matrix convention in 3D graphics and linear algebra is **row-major order**, where the last column (e.g., `matrix[0, 3]`) represents the translation vector (\(T_x, T_y, T_z\)). 

If your translation is set at `matrix[3, 0]`, it may suggest one of these scenarios:

1. **Column-Major Order**: Some systems, such as OpenGL, store matrices in **column-major order**, where translation components are found in the **last row** instead of the last column.
   \[
   \begin{bmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
   T_x & T_y & T_z & 1
   \end{bmatrix}
   \]

   In this case:
   - \(T_x\) is in `matrix[3, 0]`.
   - \(T_y\) is in `matrix[3, 1]`.
   - \(T_z\) is in `matrix[3, 2]`.

2. **Transposed Matrix**: Your matrix might have been transposed, which swaps rows and columns, placing the translation values in a different location.

### Confirming the Matrix Order
To confirm:
- Check how your system defines its transformation matrices.
- Verify how the multiplication works (e.g., vector-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication order).

### Adjust Your Code
If your system indeed uses the last **row** for translation (column-major), you'd set the translation like this in NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 4x4 identity matrix
matrix = np.eye(4)

# Set translation along the X-axis in column-major format
T_x = 5  # Example translation value
matrix[3, 0] = T_x

print(matrix)
```

Output for column-major order:

\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
5 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
